
This is an adapter that allows you to use any action camera roughly the same size as a GoPro with the 3DR Solo gimbal.

The design incorporates 45 degree angles in the overhangs so that it will print well without supports.

"main.scad" contains the main code for the adapter and the bracket. You can edit this file to customite the fit of the adapter to your camera.

Use "adapter.scad" and "bracket.scad" to actually print the adapter and the bracket. The bracket is designed to be installed in place of the green clip that comes with the gimbal. Just unscrew the single screw that holds the green clip, and install the bracket instead. You use the same screw that holds the green clip in place to secure the bracket.

"side_weights.scad" and "back_weight.scad" are 3D printed weights that you can use to balance the gimbal. You can edit the parameters in those files to change the size and therefore the weight of those weights. The side weights are designed to attach onto the exposed edge of the metal bracket on the opposide side from the camera. A single M2 screw and nut are used to hold them in place.

### Description ###

This is a customizable mounting adapter that allows you to mount a "generic" action camera roughly the same size as a GoPro in the 3DR Solo gimbal.

### Overview ###

There are four parts that are includde in this design: the actual adapter, a retaining clip to attach the adapter to the gimbal, a counterbalance weight for the back of the gimbal, and another weight for the side.

The adapter is pretty self-explanatory. You push the camera into the front of the adapter and it "snaps in". To remove the camera, just pull.

The retaining clip is designed to be installed in place of the green clip that comes pre-installed on the gimbal. Just unscrew the single screw that holds the green clip, install the printed retaining clip in the same place, and use the screw you just removed to secure the clip.

The weights are intended to balance the camera in the gimbal. Depending on the weight of your camera, they may not be needed. However, if you do print them, be sure to use 100% infill, otherwise they will not be heavy enough to make much difference.

### Customization ###

You'll definitely want to customize the adapter to be an exact fit for your camera, as not all of the GoPro type clones are the same size, and it won't work well if it's not a snug fit.

For example, the defaults are setup for a GitUp Git2P, which has the following dimensions:

* Length: 59.4mm
* Width: 41.1mm
* Height: 19.6mm

My no-name SJ4000 clone has the following dimensions:

* Length: 59.8mm
* Width: 40.8mm
* Height: 25.6mm  <--- big difference in height (thickness)

Also, if you're going to use the weights, you'll need to adjust the size for your camera. The defaults are, again, for a Git2P. If you're using a different camera, you'll just need to use some trial and error to get the weight size correct.

### Printing ###

All of the parts are designed to print without supports. I printed in ABS, but the design should work in PLA. If you use PLA, you may need to be careful with the clips as they may be fragile. Also, given that the clips are fairly thin anyway, I'd your print is going to need good layer bonding / adhesion. I printed my ABS at 240C to ensure good adhesion.

**Note:** Make sure to print the weights with 100% infill, otherwise they'll be too light weight to work properly.
